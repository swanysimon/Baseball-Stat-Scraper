baseball-reference.stats
========================

Extracts stats from baseball-reference.com of each active player's major league stats.

The baseball-reference.Extraction.py only takes in player stats and does not evaluate. However, stores in a file in a single dictionary for easy future access.

Calculator.redditdynasty2.py is an example of how this data might be applied. This particular calculator was built around a specific points system for a fantasy baseball league, so you should adjust accordingly.
